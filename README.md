## ** Game description **
This is a simple version of classic Snake game. In Gluttonous-Snake, you control a snake-like creature (representing by P) within a small area by w, a, s, d on your keyboard. The goal is to get the snake to eat food and grow longer. The snake will move in a straight line until you tell it to turn. To avoid obstacles, make sure to carefully plan your movements. 
As the snake grows, it becomes more difficult to avoid hitting walls or its own tail. If the snake hits a wall or itself, the game is over.

Enjoy our game!
