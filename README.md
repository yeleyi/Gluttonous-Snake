## ** Game description **
This is a simple version of classic Snake game. In Gluttonous-Snake, you control a snake-like creature (representing by P) within a small area by w, a, s, d on your keyboard. The goal is to get the snake to eat beans (representing by B) and earn higher scores. The snake will move in a straight line until you tell it to turn. To avoid obstacles, make sure to carefully plan your movements. 
As the snake grows, the snake moves faster and it becomes more difficult to avoid hitting walls. If your snake hits the wall, the game is over.

Enjoy our game!
## ** Features **



## ** Non-standard C/C++ libraries **
We use <ncurses.h> so that the program can detect input while the game is processing. The code cbreak() from ncurses.h allows input to validate immediately without pressing enter.
